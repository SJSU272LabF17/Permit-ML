Building Permit Process Enhancement using Machine Learning
The process to obtain a building permit in San Jose is slow and tedious, primarily due
to the fact that a city staff member must review each and every permit application in order for
them to be approved. This process could be improved by training a model to handle some, if
not most of the review.

We are building a web application to predict if a user's permit will be approved or not.
We are using a machine learning model based on logistic regression to classify the data.
